# Google-Data-Analytics

I recently completed the Google Data Analytics certificate. Upon completion, I worked on a capstone project to showcase the skills that I developed througout the course, and demonstrate each step of the analysis process: **Ask**, **Prepare**, **Process**, **Analyze**, **Share**, and **Act**.

I chose to analyze the data of a fictional bikeshare company called Cyclistic. My assignment was to download 12 months worth of data, follow all steps of the data analysis process, and figure out how to increase the number of paying members for the bikeshare company. The report contains a link to [an AWS bucket](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) that contains all the CSV files that were used for the analysis. The data consists of more than 5 million observations, with each observation representing an individual bike ride. Therefore, I chose to use R for my analysis, since R enabled me to analyze a large dataset, clean the data, perform calculations, and visualize the data.

The Google Data Analytics course did provide an [R script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TTj5KNKf4BWvEORGm10oNbpwTRk1hamsWJGj6qRWpuI/edit), which gave me guidance as I completed my analysis. However, I took many further steps as I scrutinized the data, cleaned it up, and looked for details that may have not been previously apparent.

Included in this repository is my Cyclistic report, completed using R Markdown and knitted into a PDF document. Within the report, a list of all the CSV files used for the analysis is included. The files have the same names as the files in [the AWS bucket](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html), but they contain the .csv extension instead of the .zip extension.
